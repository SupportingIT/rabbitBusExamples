# Welcome to the RabbitBusExamples project.

This project includes examples of using [RabbitBus](http://github.com/derekgreer/rabbitBus), a .Net client API for RabbitMQ.

## Building the examples

RabbitBusExamples uses external dependencies retrieved via the NuGet.exe command line tool. Building the examples
requires the NuGet.exe command to be available within your system PATH.  If you don't already have the NuGet command
line tool installed, you can get it from the following location:

To build the example projects, execute the build.bat file located at the project's root folder.
